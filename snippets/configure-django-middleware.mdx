Activate the Apitally middleware in your Django application by appending it to the end of the [`MIDDLEWARE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/http/middleware/#activating-middleware) list in your Django settings.

Then configure the Apitally middleware by adding `APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE` to your settings file and including the `client_id` for your app.
You'll find the `client_id` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.
