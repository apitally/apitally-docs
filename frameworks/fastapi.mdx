This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="FastAPI" />

## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="FastAPI" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-fastapi.png)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

<AddMiddlewarePythonSnippet framework="FastAPI" extra="fastapi" />

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[fastapi]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[fastapi]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["fastapi"] }
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your FastAPI application and provide the `client_id` for your app.
You'll find the `client_id` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="dev",  # or "prod" etc.
)
```

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumer_identifier` attribute on the [`request.state`](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#other-state) object.
You could do this <Tooltip tip="See example below">in a dependency</Tooltip> or another middleware, for example.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Request
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str

async def get_current_user(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    user = fake_decode_token(token)
    return user

def identify_consumer(request: Request, current_user: Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]):
    request.state.consumer_identifier = current_user.username

app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(identify_consumer)])
```
