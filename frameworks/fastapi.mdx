## Basic setup

First, create a new app in Apitally and select FastAPI as your framework.

Install the [Apitally Python client](https://pypi.org/project/apitally/) in your FastAPI project (e.g. using `pip` or `poetry`) with the `fastapi` extra.

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install apitally[fastapi]
```

```toml poetry (pyproject.toml)
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["fastapi"] }
```

</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your FastAPI application and provide the `client_id` for your app.
The `client_id` is displayed in Apitally immediately after creating the app or on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app.

<CodeGroup>

```python Default env
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id")
```

```python Custom env
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-5">
  <Note>
    If you're also using other middlewares, put the `ApitallyMiddleware` first,
    so that it wraps the existing stack of middlewares.
  </Note>
</div>

If you have multiple environments for your application, provide the name of the current environment using the `env` argument (use alphanumeric characters and hyphens only).

New environments will be visible in Apitally as soon as data is received from them. You can mark environments as production or non-production in the _Manage environments_ modal.

## Using API key authentication

First, to enable the synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application, set the `enable_keys` argument to `True` when adding the middleware.

```python
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    enable_keys=True,  # <--
)
```

<div className="-mt-3">
  <Info>
    The synchronization happens once at application startup and then every 60
    seconds.
  </Info>
</div>

To secure an endpoint with API key authentication, use the `Security` dependency and pass `api_key_auth` as the first argument.
You can optionally specify a list of `scopes` that the API key must have.

If you want to access information about the API key in your endpoint function, add the dependency as an argument to the function instead.

You can also secure the whole application (or a router) by passing the `Security` dependency to the `dependencies` argument of the `FastAPI` (or `Router`) constructor.

<CodeGroup>

```python Endpoint dependency
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security

from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware, api_key_auth

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id", enable_keys=True)

@app.get("/foo", dependencies=[Security(api_key_auth, scopes=["read:foo"]))
def foo():
    return "foo"
```

```python Endpoint function argument
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security

from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware, KeyInfo, api_key_auth

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id", enable_keys=True)

@app.get("/foo")
def foo(key: KeyInfo = Security(api_key_auth, scopes=["read:foo"])):
    return "foo"
```

```python App dependency
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security

from apitally.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware, api_key_auth

app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Security(api_key_auth)]
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id", enable_keys=True)

@app.get("/foo")
def foo():
    return "foo"
```
