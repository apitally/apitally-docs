This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Fastify application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that are easily managed through our dashboard
- Use scopes to control different levels of access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Fastify as your framework.

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-fastify.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add plugin

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apitally) and the [fastify-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-plugin) package in your Fastify project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install apitally fastify-plugin
```

```shell yarn
yarn add apitally fastify-plugin
```
</CodeGroup>

Register the Apitally plugin with your Fastify application and provide the `clientId` for your app.
You'll find the `clientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ESM
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { apitallyPlugin } from "apitally/fastify";

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```

```javascript CommonJS
const fastify = require("fastify")({ logger: true });
const { apitallyPlugin } = require("apitally/fastify");

fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});

// Wrap your routes in a plugin, so Apitally can detect them
fastify.register((instance, opts, done) => {
  instance.get("/", (request, reply) => {
    reply.send("hello");
  });
  done();
});
```
</CodeGroup>

</div>

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumerIdentifier` property on the [`Request`](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Request/) object, for example in your authentication function.

```javascript
fastify.addHook("onRequest", async (request, reply) => {
  try {
    await request.jwtVerify(); // Assuming @fastify/jwt is used for authentication
    request.consumerIdentifier = request.user.name;
  } catch (err) {
    reply.send(err);
  }
});
```

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

<Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your Fastify application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set the `syncApiKeys` argument to `True` when registering the plugin.

```javascript
await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  syncApiKeys: true, // <--
});
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

Use the `requireApiKey` function in a `preValidation` hook to secure your routes with API key authentication and use the optional `scopes` argument to specify required scopes. This can be done either at the route level or in a shared hook.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Route (ESM)
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { apitallyPlugin, requireApiKey } from "apitally/fastify";

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  syncApiKeys: true,
});

fastify.get(
  "/hello",
  {
    preValidation: requireApiKey({ scopes: "hello" }),
  },
  async function (request) {
    // Access API key info via request.keyInfo
    const apiKeyName = request.keyInfo.name;
    const apiKeyScopes = request.keyInfo.scopes.join(", ");
    return `Hello ${apiKeyName}! Your scopes are: ${apiKeyScopes}`;
  },
);
```

```javascript Shared (ESM)
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { apitallyPlugin, requireApiKey } from "apitally/fastify";

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  syncApiKeys: true,
});

fastify.addHook("preValidation", requireApiKey())
```

```javascript Route (CommonJS)
const fastify = require("fastify")({ logger: true });
const { apitallyPlugin, requireApiKey } = require("apitally/fastify");

await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  syncApiKeys: true,
});

fastify.get(
  "/hello",
  {
    preValidation: requireApiKey({ scopes: "hello" }),
  },
  async function (request) {
    // Access API key info via request.keyInfo
    const apiKeyName = request.keyInfo.name;
    const apiKeyScopes = request.keyInfo.scopes.join(", ");
    return `Hello ${apiKeyName}! Your scopes are: ${apiKeyScopes}`;
  },
);
```
</CodeGroup>

You can access information about the API key in your route handler function via the `request.keyInfo` property.
This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply pass the `customHeader` argument to the `requireApiKey` function.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Route
fastify.get(
  "/hello",
  {
    preValidation: requireApiKey({ customHeader: "ApiKey" }),
  },
  async function (request) {
    // ...
  },
);
```

```javascript Shared
fastify.addHook("preValidation", requireApiKey({ customHeader: "ApiKey" }))
```
</CodeGroup>
