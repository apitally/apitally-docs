This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Django Ninja application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that can be easily managed through our dashboard
- Manage scopes to control access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Django Ninja as your framework.

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-django-ninja.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://pypi.org/project/apitally/) in your Django project (e.g. using `pip` or `poetry`) with the `django_ninja` extra.

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[django_ninja]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[django_ninja]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["django_ninja"] }
```

</CodeGroup>

<Snippet file="configure-django-middleware.mdx" />

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middlewares first ...
    "apitally.django_ninja.ApitallyMiddleware",
]
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "your-env-name",
}
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="add-middleware-check.mdx" />
</div>

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, provide a <Tooltip tip="See example below">callback function</Tooltip> to the `ApitallyMiddleware` that takes a [`HttpRequest`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects) object as an argument and returns a consumer identifier or `None`.

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

<CodeGroup>

```python Callback function definition
from django.http import HttpRequest

def identify_consumer(request: HttpRequest) -> str | None:
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return request.user.username
    return None
```

```python Middleware settings
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "your-env-name",
    "identify_consumer_callback": "your_project.api.utils.identify_consumer",
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />
</div>

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your Django Ninja application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set `sync_api_keys` to `True` in the middleware settings.

```python
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "your-env-name",
    "sync_api_keys": True,  # <--
}
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

To secure your endpoints with API key authentication provide `APIKeyAuth` objects as the `auth` argument to the endpoint decorators.
Use the optional `scopes` argument to specify required scopes.

You can access information about the API key in your endpoint function via the `request.auth` object.
This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<CodeGroup>

```python Authentication
from ninja import NinjaAPI
from apitally.django_ninja import APIKeyAuth

api = NinjaAPI()

@api.get("/items", auth=APIKeyAuth(scopes=["read:items"]))
def list_items() -> list[str]:
    return ["item1"]
```

```python Access key info
from django.http import HttpRequest
from ninja import NinjaAPI
from apitally.django_ninja import APIKeyAuth

api = NinjaAPI()

@api.get("/items", auth=APIKeyAuth())
def list_items(request: HttpRequest) -> list[str]:
    assert request.auth.has_scopes(["read:items"])  # type: ignore
    print("Key name:", request.auth.name)  # type: ignore
    print("Key scopes:", request.auth.scopes)  # type: ignore
    return ["item1"]
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply define your own `APIKeyAuth` class based on `APIKeyAuthBase` and set the `param_name` class variable.

```python
from apitally.django_ninja import APIKeyAuthBase

class APIKeyAuth(APIKeyAuthBase):
    param_name = "ApiKey"

@api.get("/items", auth=APIKeyAuth())
def list_items() -> list[str]:
    return ["item1"]
```
