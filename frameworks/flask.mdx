This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="Flask" />


## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="Flask" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-flask.png)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

<AddMiddlewarePythonSnippet framework="Flask" extra="flask" />

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[flask]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[flask]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["flask"] }
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Flask application and provide the `client_id` for your app.
You'll find the `client_id` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

```python
from flask import Flask
from apitally.flask import ApitallyMiddleware

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="dev",  # or "prod" etc.
)
```

</div>

<Warning>
  If you're using uWSGI to serve your Flask app in production, make sure to run it with the<br />`--enable-threads` and `--lazy-apps` options. Otherwise the Apitally client won't work correctly.
</Warning>

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumer_identifier` attribute on the [`g`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/appcontext/#storing-data) object, for example in a [`before_request`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.Flask.before_request) function.

```python
from flask import g, request

@app.before_request
def identify_consumer():
    """Identify consumer based on their IP address."""
    g.consumer_identifier = request.remote_addr
```
