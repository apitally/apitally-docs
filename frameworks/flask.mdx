This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Flask application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that are easily managed through our dashboard
- Use scopes to control different levels of access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Flask as your framework.

![Create app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apitally/assets/main/screenshots/create-app-flask.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://pypi.org/project/apitally/) in your Starlette project (e.g. using `pip` or `poetry`) with the `flask` extra.

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[flask]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[flask]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["flask"] }
```

</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Flask application and provide the `client_id` for your app.
The `client_id` is displayed in the Apitally dashboard immediately after creating the app or on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app.

You can use the optional `env` argument to provide a name for the current environment, otherwise _default_ will be used.
New environments will be visible in Apitally as soon as data is received from them. You can mark environments as production or non-production on the _Manage environments_ screen.

```python
from flask import Flask
from apitally.flask import ApitallyMiddleware

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
)
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="other-middlewares-note.mdx" />
</div>

<Snippet file="add-middleware-check.mdx" />

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumer_identifier` attribute on the [`g`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/appcontext/#storing-data) object, for example in a [`before_request`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.Flask.before_request) function.

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

```python
from flask import g, request

@app.before_request
def identify_consumer():
    """Identify consumer based on their IP address."""
    g.consumer_identifier = request.remote_addr
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />
</div>

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your Flask application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set the `sync_api_keys` argument to `True` when adding the middleware.

```python
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    sync_api_keys=True,  # <--
)
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

Use the `@require_api_key` decorator on your Flask route functions to secure them with API key authentication
and add the optional `scopes` argument to specify required scopes.

You can access information about the API key in your endpoint function via the `g.key_info` object.
This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<CodeGroup>

```python Authentication
from flask import Flask
from apitally.flask import ApitallyMiddleware, require_api_key

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    sync_api_keys=True,
)

@app.route("/items")
@require_api_key(scopes=["read:items"])
def list_items():
    return ["item1"]
```

```python Access key info
from flask import Flask, g
from apitally.flask import ApitallyMiddleware, require_api_key

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    sync_api_keys=True,
)

@app.route("/items")
@require_api_key
def list_items():
    assert g.key_info.has_scopes(["read:items"])
    print("Key name:", g.key_info.name)
    print("Key scopes:", g.key_info.scopes)
    return ["item1"]
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply pass the `custom_header` argument to the `@require_api_key` decorator.
You can use [`functools.partial`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial) to avoid repeating this for every route.

<CodeGroup>

```python Custom header
from apitally.flask import require_api_key

@app.route("/items")
@require_api_key(custom_header="ApiKey")
def list_items():
    return ["item1"]
```

```python Custom header with functools.partial
from functools import partial
from apitally.flask import require_api_key

require_api_key = partial(require_api_key, custom_header="ApiKey")

@app.route("/items")
@require_api_key
def list_items():
    return ["item1"]
```

</CodeGroup>
