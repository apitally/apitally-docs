This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Express](https://expressjs.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="Express" />

## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="Express" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-express.png)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apitally) in your Express project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install apitally
```

```shell yarn
yarn add apitally
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Express application using the `useApitally` function and provide the `clientId` for your app.
You'll find the `clientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ESM
import express from "express";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```

```javascript CommonJS
const express = require("express");
const { useApitally } = require("apitally/express");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumerIdentifier` property on the [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) in a middleware.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Example
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.consumerIdentifier = req.user.username
  }
  next()
})
```

```javascript Example for TypeScript
import type { Request } from "express";

declare module "express" {
  interface Request {
    consumerIdentifier?: string;
  }
}

app.use(function (req: Request, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.consumerIdentifier = req.user.username
  }
  next()
})
```
