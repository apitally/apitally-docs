This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Starlette application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that are easily managed through our dashboard
- Use scopes to control different levels of access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Starlette as your framework.

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-starlette.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://pypi.org/project/apitally/) in your Starlette project (e.g. using `pip` or `poetry`) with the `starlette` extra.

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[starlette]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[starlette]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["starlette"] }
```

</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Starlette application and provide the `client_id` for your app.
The `client_id` is displayed in the Apitally dashboard immediately after creating the app or on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app.

You can use the optional `env` argument to provide a name for the current environment, otherwise _default_ will be used.
New environments will be visible in Apitally as soon as data is received from them. You can mark environments as production or non-production on the _Manage environments_ screen.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from apitally.starlette import ApitallyMiddleware

app = Starlette(routes=[...])
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
)
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="other-middlewares-note.mdx" />
</div>

<Snippet file="add-middleware-check.mdx" />

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, provide a <Tooltip tip="See example below">callback function</Tooltip> to the `ApitallyMiddleware` that takes a [`Request`](https://www.starlette.io/requests/) object as an argument and returns a consumer identifier or `None`.

Alternatively, you can set the `consumer_identifier` attribute on the [`request.state`](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#other-state) object, for example in another middleware or directly in your endpoint functions.

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

<CodeGroup>

```python Callback function
from starlette.requests import Request

def identify_consumer(request: Request) -> str | None:
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return request.user.identity
    return None

app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    identify_consumer_callback=identify_consumer,
)
```

```python State object
from starlette.requests import Request

def list_items(request: Request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        request.state.consumer_identifier = request.user.identity
    return ["item1"]
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />
</div>

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your Starlette application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set the `sync_api_keys` argument to `True` when adding the middleware.

```python
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="your-env-name",
    sync_api_keys=True,  # <--
)
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

Add Starlette's [`AuthenticationMiddleware`](https://www.starlette.io/authentication/) with the `APIKeyAuth` backend to your app,
and then use the [`@requires`](https://www.starlette.io/authentication/#permissions) decorator to secure your endpoints.
Always include the `authenticated` scope and optionally any other required scopes.

You can access information about the API key in your endpoint function via the [`request.user`](https://www.starlette.io/authentication/#users) and
[`request.auth`](https://www.starlette.io/authentication/#authcredentials) objects. This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<CodeGroup>

```python Authentication
from starlette.authentication import requires
from starlette.middleware.authentication import AuthenticationMiddleware
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.routing import Route
from apitally.starlette import ApitallyMiddleware, APIKeyAuth

@requires(["authenticated", "read:items"])
def list_items(request: Request):
    return ["item1"]

routes = [
    Route("/items", list_items, methods=["GET"]),
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id", sync_api_keys=True)
app.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware, backend=APIKeyAuth())
```

```python Access key info
from starlette.authentication import requires
from starlette.middleware.authentication import AuthenticationMiddleware
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.routing import Route
from apitally.starlette import ApitallyMiddleware, APIKeyAuth

@requires(["authenticated"])
def list_items(request: Request):
    assert request.user.is_authenticated
    assert request.auth.has_scopes(["read:items"])
    print("Key name:", request.user.display_name)
    print("Key scopes:", request.auth.scopes)
    return ["item1"]

routes = [
    Route("/items", list_items, methods=["GET"]),
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
app.add_middleware(ApitallyMiddleware, client_id="your-client-id", sync_api_keys=True)
app.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware, backend=APIKeyAuth())
```

</CodeGroup>

By default, Starlette returns a `400 Bad Request` response when users provide an invalid API key.
You can customize this behavior by providing your own `on_error` callback to the authentication middleware.

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse, Response
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

def on_auth_error(request: Request, exc: Exception) -> Response:
    return PlainTextResponse(str(exc), status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)

app.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware, backend=APIKeyAuth(), on_error=on_auth_error)
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply provide the `custom_header` argument to the `APIKeyAuth` backend before adding the authentication middleware.

```python
auth_backend = APIKeyAuth(custom_header="ApiKey")
app.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware, backend=auth_backend)
```
