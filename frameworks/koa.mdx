This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Koa](https://koajs.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Koa application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that are easily managed through our dashboard
- Use scopes to control different levels of access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Koa as your framework.

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-koa.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apitally) in your Koa project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install apitally
```

```shell yarn
yarn add apitally
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Koa application using the `useApitally` function and provide the `clientId` for your app.
You'll find the `clientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ESM
import Koa from "koa";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/koa";

const app = new Koa();

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "default", // or "dev", "prod" etc. (optional)
});
```

```javascript CommonJS
const Koa = require("koa");
const { useApitally } = require("apitally/koa");

const app = new Koa();

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "default", // or "dev", "prod" etc. (optional)
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="middleware-first-note.mdx" />
</div>

<Snippet file="env-argument.mdx" />

<Snippet file="add-middleware-check.mdx" />

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `consumerIdentifier` variable on the [`ctx.state`](https://koajs.com/#context) property in a middleware.

```javascript
app.use(function (ctx, next) {
  if (ctx.isAuthenticated()) {
    ctx.state.consumerIdentifier = ctx.state.user.username
  }
  next()
})
```

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

<Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your Koa application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set the `syncApiKeys` argument to `True` when adding the middleware.

```javascript
useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "default",
  syncApiKeys: true, // <--
});
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

Add the middleware returned by the `requireApiKey` function to your routes to secure them with API key authentication and use the optional `scopes` argument to specify required scopes.

<Note>
The example below assumes your application uses the [@koa/router](https://npmjs.com/package/@koa/router) package, but it should work similarly with other router middlewares.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ESM
import Koa from "koa";
import Router from "@koa/router";
import { useApitally, requireApiKey } from "apitally/koa";

const app = new Koa();
const router = new Router();

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "default",
  syncApiKeys: true,
});

router.get(
  "/hello",
  requireApiKey({ scopes: ["hello"] }), // <--
  async (ctx) => {
    // Access API key info via ctx.state.keyInfo
    const apiKeyName = ctx.state.keyInfo.name;
    const apiKeyScopes = ctx.state.keyInfo.scopes.join(", ");
    ctx.body = `Hello ${apiKeyName}! Your scopes are: ${apiKeyScopes}`;
  }
);

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());
```

```javascript CommonJS
const Koa = require('koa');
const Router = require('@koa/router');
const { useApitally, requireApiKey } = require("apitally/koa");

const app = new Koa();
const router = new Router();

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "default",
  syncApiKeys: true,
});

router.get(
  "/hello",
  requireApiKey({ scopes: ["hello"] }), // <--
  async (ctx) => {
    // Access API key info via ctx.state.keyInfo
    const apiKeyName = ctx.state.keyInfo.name;
    const apiKeyScopes = ctx.state.keyInfo.scopes.join(", ");
    ctx.body = `Hello ${apiKeyName}! Your scopes are: ${apiKeyScopes}`;
  }
);

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());
```
</CodeGroup>

You can access information about the API key in your route handler function via the `ctx.state.keyInfo` property.
This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply pass the `customHeader` argument to the `requireApiKey` function.

```javascript
router.get(
  "/hello",
  requireApiKey({ customHeader: "ApiKey" }),
  async (ctx) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```
