This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Hono](https://hono.dev) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="Hono" />

<Warning>Apitally currently doesn't work on serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda or Cloudflare Workers.</Warning>

## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="Hono" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-hono.webp)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apitally) in your Hono project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install apitally
```

```shell yarn
yarn add apitally
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Hono application using the `useApitally` function and provide the `clientId` for your app.
You'll find the `clientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

```javascript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/hono";

const app = new Hono();

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `apitallyConsumer` key on the [`Context`](https://hono.dev/docs/api/context#set-get) object in a middleware.

```javascript
app.use(async (c, next) => {
  const consumerIdentifier = c.get("jwtPayload")?.sub;
  c.set("apitallyConsumer", consumerIdentifier);
  await next();
});
```

<ConsumerIdentifierSnippet />

<Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />

## Name and group consumers

<ConsumerNameGroupSnippet language="javascript" />

```javascript
app.use(async (c, next) => {
  const payload = c.get("jwtPayload");
  if (payload) {
    c.set("apitallyConsumer", {
      identifier: payload.sub,
      name: payload.name,
      group: payload.group
    });
  }
  await next();
});
```
