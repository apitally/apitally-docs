This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) (DRF) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

Once you're done with this guide, you will be able to:

- Monitor traffic to your Django REST Framework application
- Keep track of response times and errors
- Understand how individual consumers use your application
- Secure your application with API keys that can be easily managed through our dashboard
- Manage scopes to control access to your endpoints

## Create app

To get started, create a new app in the [Apitally dashboard](https://app.apitally.io/apps) and select Django REST Framework as your framework.

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-django-rest-framework.png)

Take a note of the client ID displayed after submitting. You will need it in the next step.

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally client library](https://pypi.org/project/apitally/) in your Django project (e.g. using `pip` or `poetry`) with the `django_rest_framework` extra.

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install "apitally[django_rest_framework]"
```

```shell poetry
poetry add "apitally[django_rest_framework]"
```

```toml pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apitally = { version = "*", extras = ["django_rest_framework"] }
```
</CodeGroup>

<Snippet file="configure-django-middleware.mdx" />

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "apitally.django_rest_framework.ApitallyMiddleware",
    # Other middleware ...
]
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "dev",  # or "prod" etc.
}
```

<Snippet file="env-argument.mdx" />

<Snippet file="add-middleware-check.mdx" />

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, provide a <Tooltip tip="See example below">callback function</Tooltip> to the `ApitallyMiddleware` that takes a [`HttpRequest`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects) object as an argument and returns a consumer identifier or `None`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Callback function definition
from django.http import HttpRequest

def identify_consumer(request: HttpRequest) -> str | None:
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return request.user.username
    return None
```

```python Middleware settings
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "dev",  # or "prod" etc.
    "identify_consumer_callback": "your_project.api.utils.identify_consumer",
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Snippet file="consumer-identifier.mdx" />

<Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />

## Configure API key authentication

To secure your DRF application with API key authentication, you first have to enable synchronization of API key hashes from Apitally to your application.
Simply set `sync_api_keys` to `True` in the middleware settings.

```python
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "dev",  # or "prod" etc.
    "sync_api_keys": True,  # <--
}
```

<div className="-mt-4">
  <Snippet file="api-key-sync-info.mdx" />
</div>

To secure your API views with API key authentication use the `HasAPIKey` permission class or
the `HasAPIKeyWithScopes` permission class factory, if you need to specify required scopes.

<CodeGroup>
```python Class-based view
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.request import Request
from rest_framework.response import Response
from apitally.django_rest_framework import HasAPIKey

class ListItemsView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [HasAPIKey]

    def get(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        return Response(["item1"])
```

```python Class-based view with scopes
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.request import Request
from rest_framework.response import Response
from apitally.django_rest_framework import HasAPIKeyWithScopes

class ListItemsView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [HasAPIKeyWithScopes(["read:items"])]

    def get(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        return Response(["item1"])
```

```python Function-based view
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.request import Request
from rest_framework.response import Response
from apitally.django_rest_framework import HasAPIKeyWithScopes

@api_view()
@permission_classes([HasAPIKeyWithScopes(["read:items"])])
def list_items(request: Request) -> Response:
    return Response(["item1"])
```

```python Access key info
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.request import Request
from rest_framework.response import Response
from apitally.django_rest_framework import HasAPIKey

@api_view()
@permission_classes([HasAPIKey])
def list_items(request: Request) -> Response:
    assert request.auth.has_scopes(["read:items"])
    print("Key name:", request.auth.name)
    print("Key scopes:", request.auth.scopes)
    return Response(["item1"])
```
</CodeGroup>

You can access information about the API key in your endpoint function via the `request.auth` object.
This can be useful if you need to check scopes dynamically, for example.

<div className="mt-4">
  <Snippet file="configure-api-key-auth-check.mdx" />
</div>

### Custom header

While it is recommended to use the standard `Authorization` header for API key authentication,
you can configure your application to accept a custom header instead.
Simply set `APITALLY_CUSTOM_API_KEY_HEADER` in your Django settings file.

```python
APITALLY_CUSTOM_API_KEY_HEADER = "ApiKey"
```
