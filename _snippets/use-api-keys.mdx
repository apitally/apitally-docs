## Use API keys

Unless you have configured your application to accept API keys in a custom header,
clients must provide an API key in the `Authorization` header using the `ApiKey` scheme prefix.

```shell curl
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey your-api-key" https://api.your-company.com/items
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.your-company.com/items",
    headers={"Authorization": "ApiKey your-api-key"},
)
```
