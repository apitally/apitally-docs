In order to analyze API traffic by consumers in Apitally, your application must identify which consumers requests are coming from.

<Tip>
  If your application uses API keys managed through Apitally, you can skip this
  section. Consumers will be identified **automatically** based on the API key
  used.
</Tip>

How you identify consumers depends on your application and use case. If your application uses authentication, it would make sense to use the authenticated identity (e.g. username or API key name) as the consumer identifier.
