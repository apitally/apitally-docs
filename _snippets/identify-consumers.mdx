In order to analyze API traffic by consumers in Apitally, your application must
identify which consumers requests are coming from.

<Tip>
  If your application uses API key authentication with Apitally, you can skip
  this section. Consumers will be identified automatically based on the API key
  used.
</Tip>

How you identify API consumers depends on your application and use case. If your
application uses authentication, it would make sense to use the authenticated
identity (e.g. username) as the consumer identifier.
