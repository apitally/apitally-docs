Activate the Apitally middleware in your Django application by appending it to the end of the [`MIDDLEWARE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/http/middleware/#activating-middleware) list in your Django settings.

Then configure the Apitally middleware by adding `APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE` to your settings file and including the `client_id` for your app.
The `client_id` is displayed in the Apitally dashboard immediately after creating the app or on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app.

You can use the optional `env` key to provide a name for the current environment, otherwise _default_ will be used.
New environments will be visible in Apitally as soon as data is received from them. You can mark environments as production or non-production on the _Manage environments_ screen.
