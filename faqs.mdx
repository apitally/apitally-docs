#### What data is being collected by Apitally?

Only metadata, such as the HTTP method, path, and response status code, is
collected. The request body and response body are never collected. Our client libraries are
open-source, so you can verify this for yourself.

#### Where are my API keys stored?

Your API keys are never stored by Apitally or synchronized with your
application. Instead, [secure hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)
are used to verify if a client-provided API key is valid.

#### Can Apitally replace an APM solution?

Apitally only provides aggregated statistics on response times and error rates.
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions usually allow you to investigate
individual requests and show traces of which parts of your code took how long to execute.
As such, Apitally is not a replacement for an APM solution.

#### I'm using a framework that currently isn't supported. Will you add support for it?

We're happy to consider it. Please reach out to discuss your use case.
