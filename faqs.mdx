#### How does Apitally work?

Our client libraries implement a simple middleware that intercepts API requests and responses,
aggregates relevant metadata, and sends it to Apitally's servers in 1 minute intervals.
This happens asynchronously as to not impact the performance of your application.

#### How is Apitally different to other solutions?

Apitally is a simple, lightweight and cost-effective solution that doesn't require you to change
your infrastructure. Most alternatives work by proxying your API traffic through their service.
Apitally adds a small dependency to your source code instead, offering in particular smaller teams
an easier path to adoption.<br />
Apitally also has no limits on or charges per number of requests, so you can scale
your API traffic without worrying about additional costs.<br />
If you just need a simple and affordable way to monitor your API traffic and/or manage API keys and
don't require an enterprise-grade solution with all the bells and whistles, Apitally might be a good fit for you.

#### Which web frameworks does Apitally support?

The following frameworks are currently supported:

1. FastAPI (Python)
2. Starlette (Python)
3. Flask (Python)
4. Django Ninja (Python)
5. Django REST Framework (Python)

Support for more web frameworks is planned in the future.

#### Does the Apitally middleware impact my application's performance?

No, the Apitally client libraries are designed to have minimal impact on your application's performance.
If your web framework is asynchronous, the Apitally client will perform its tasks without blocking the main event loop.
For web frameworks that are not asynchronous, Apitally utilizes a separate thread instead.

#### What data is being collected by Apitally?

The Apitally middleware only collects metadata about your API endpoints as well as requests and responses.
This includes HTTP methods, paths, response status codes and timing.
The request and response headers and bodies are never recorded by Apitally, so you don't have to worry about exposing sensitive data.
Our client libraries are open-source, so you can verify this for yourself.

#### Does Apitally store my API keys?

No, your API keys are never stored by Apitally or synchronized with your application in plain text.
Instead, secure hashes are used to verify if a provided API key is valid.

#### What hashing algorithm does Apitally use for API keys?

Apitally uses [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) to hash API keys, along with a random salt.
Scrypt is known for its memory-intensive design which makes it challenging and resource-consuming for attackers to crack using brute force.
Trusted by many in the cryptographic community, scrypt provides a high degree of security for your API keys.

#### Can I import existing API keys into Apitally?

Yes, Apitally makes it easy to import your existing API keys, so you can migrate to Apitally without disrupting existing consumers.

#### Is support for other web frameworks planned in the future?

Yes, the following frameworks are currently on our roadmap, in order of priority and subject to change:

1. Falcon (Python)
2. Sanic (Python)
3. Express (Node.js)
4. Koa (Node.js)
5. Spring Boot (Java)
6. Gin (Go)
