#### How does Apitally work?

Our client libraries implement a simple middleware that intercepts API requests and responses,
aggregates relevant metadata, and sends it to Apitally's servers in 1 minute intervals.
This happens asynchronously as to not impact the performance of your application.

#### How is Apitally different to other solutions?

Apitally is a simple, lightweight and cost-effective solution that doesn't require you to change
your infrastructure. Most alternatives work by proxying your API traffic through their service.
Apitally adds a small dependency to your source code instead, offering in particular smaller teams
an easier path to adoption.<br />
If you just need a simple way to monitor your API traffic and/or manage API keys and
don't require an enterprise-grade API management solution, Apitally might be a good fit for you.

#### What data is being collected by Apitally?

Only metadata, such as the HTTP method, path, and response status code, is
collected by Apitally. The request and response body are never sent to Apitally, so you don't have to worry about exposing sensitive data.
Our client libraries are open-source, so you can verify this for yourself.

#### Does Apitally store my API keys?

No! Your API keys are never stored by Apitally or synchronized with your application in plain text.
Instead, secure hashes are used to verify if a provided API key is valid.

#### What hashing algorithm does Apitally use for API keys?

Apitally uses [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) to hash API keys, along with a random salt.
Scrypt is known for its memory-intensive design which makes it challenging and resource-consuming for attackers to crack using brute force.
Trusted by many in the cryptographic community, scrypt provides a high degree of security for your API keys.

#### Can I start managing my API keys with Apitally without disrupting existing consumers?

Yes! Apitally makes it easy to import your existing API keys, so you can migrate to Apitally without disrupting existing consumers.

#### Is support for other web frameworks planned in the future?

Yes! The following frameworks are currently on our roadmap, in order of priority and subject to change:

1. Falcon (Python)
2. Express (Node.js)
3. Koa (Node.js)
4. Spring Boot (Java)
5. Gin (Go)
