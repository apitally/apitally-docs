## API traffic monitoring

- Monitor your API traffic in near real-time, per consumer, endpoint and across multiple environments
- Track client and server errors to quickly understand which endpoints are causing issues for your users
- Gain insights into validation errors your users are encountering (FastAPI and Django Ninja only)
- Understand which status codes are being returned by your endpoints
- Track your endpoints' response times, and identify which ones are performing poorly
- Aggregate metrics by hour, day, or month, with data retention of up to one year
- Automatically detect all endpoints in your application through introspection, even those that haven't been used yet

## API key management

- Easily create and manage API keys for your users
- Define scopes and assign them to API keys for fine-grained access control to your endpoints
- Set expiry dates on API keys to automatically revoke access after a period of time
- Rotate API keys with a configurable grace period to avoid service interruptions
- Disable API keys to immediately revoke access (and re-enable them later if needed)
- Track the usage of API keys
- Import existing API keys
- Easily set up API key authentication in your application with our client libraries
- Rest assured that your API keys are never stored by Apitally

## Roadmap

- Support for more REST API frameworks (e.g. Spring Boot, Express)
- Hosted auto-generated API documentation
- Alerting
