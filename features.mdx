![Insights screenshot](/images/insights.png)

- Monitor your API traffic in real-time, on a per-endpoint basis, and across multiple environments
- Identify and track client and server errors, and quickly understand which endpoints are causing issues for your users
- Gain insights into validation errors your users are encountering (if supported by your framework)
- Track which status codes are being returned by your endpoints
- Understand your endpoints' response times, and identify which ones are performing poorly
- Aggregate metrics by hour, day, or month, with data retention of up to one year
- Automatically detect all endpoints in your application through introspection, even those that haven't been used yet

## API key management

- Easily create and manage API keys for your users
- Define scopes and assign them to API keys for fine-grained access control to your endpoints
- Set expiry dates on API keys to automatically revoke access after a period of time
- Rotate API keys with a configurable grace period to avoid service interruptions
- Track the usage of API keys
- Easily set up API key authentication in your application with our client libraries
- Rest assured that your API keys are never stored by Apitally
