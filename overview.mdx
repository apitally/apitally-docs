## Key features

- Monitor API traffic, errors, and response times with our simple dashboard.
- Get insights into the usage and performance of each endpoint.
- Filter by consumer to understand different usage patterns.
- Easily secure your endpoints with API key authentication.
- Manage API keys, scopes and permissions in our simple dashboard.
- Track API key usage and expire or rotate API keys without causing disruptions.

## Why Apitally?

- Integrates directly with your applications via middleware and does not require rerouting of your API traffic or an agent to be installed separately. No impact on performance.
- Never collects or stores sensitive data. Operates on non-sensitive metadata only.
- Works for internal APIs in private subnets just as well as public-facing APIs.
- Supports the most popular REST API frameworks in Python through an [open-source client library](https://github.com/apitally/python-client). Support for other languages coming soon.
- Built specifically for small teams or individual developers who value simple architectures and affordable services, but scales comfortably for larger teams too.
