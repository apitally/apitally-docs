## Consumer insights

Understanding how different consumers interact with your API, which endpoints they use, what errors they encounter and the latencies they experience can yield meaningful insights.

Apitally shows you an overview of all identified API consumers, including traffic sparkline graphs for a quick overview of traffic patterns, error rates and the time of the last request.
From there, you can click through to the *Traffic* dashboard filtered to requests from a specific consumer.

  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>

To use this feature, your application must identify API consumers by providing a unique consumer identifier for each request. Check out the [setup guide](/quickstart) for your framework to learn more (it's easy!).
