## Traffic monitoring

Apitally keeps track of all requests handled by your API and provides insights into the overall traffic as well as the usage of each endpoint.
On the *Traffic* dashboard you can choose to analyze requests for time ranges from just the last hour to 12 months.

If your application is set up to identify API consumers (learn more [below](#consumers)), you can filter the dashboard to show only requests from individual consumers.

Particularly useful for users monitoring multiple applications, Apitally also includes sparkline graphs on the *Apps* page for a quick overview of traffic patterns across apps.
This can help to quickly identify unexpected spikes or drops in traffic for any of your apps.

    If your application includes health check endpoints that are called frequently, you can easily exclude them from the traffic analysis using the dropdown menu for each endpoint.

## Error monitoring

Monitoring API errors is crucial for maintaining a robust system.
Server errors (5xx) usually signal underlying issues with your API, such as bugs in your code or networking problems.

Paying attention to client errors (4xx) is equally important, even if some are anticipated and not indicative of API problems.
Analyzing client errors can provide valuable insights into how systems interact with your API.
It can aid in refining your API's design or documentation, and even uncover potential issues within those systems.

The Apitally dashboard allows you to visualize error rates over time and per endpoint and gives you a breakdown of response status codes.

### Validation errors

Validating incoming requests is a fundamental task for API developers and frameworks.
Many frameworks offer built-in validation capabilities, or are compatible with third-party validation libraries.

Apitally provides insights into specific validation errors encountered by your API consumers, which can help you refine validation rules or reveal issues on the consumer side.

This feature is currently supported for the following frameworks:

- FastAPI (using pydantic)
- Django Ninja (using pydantic)
- Litestar (using pydantic, attrs or other modeling libraries)
- Express (using express-validator or Joi + celebrate)
- Fastify (using Ajv)
- NestJS (using class-validator)

## Performance monitoring

Apitally measures the time it takes your application to respond to API requests and gives you valueable performance insights for the whole API and individual endpoints.
You can analyze different percentiles of response times (p50, p75 and p95) over time and view a histogram of response times for specific endpoints.

  </div>

## Payload sizes

Apitally records the payload size of each API request and response based on the `Content-Length` headers.
It provides insights into the distribution of payload sizes for specific endpoints as well as the overall amount of data transferred.

  </div>
</Card>

## Consumer insights

Understanding how different consumers interact with your API, which endpoints they use, what errors they encounter and the latencies they experience can yield meaningful insights.

Apitally shows you an overview of all identified API consumers, including traffic sparkline graphs for a quick overview of traffic patterns, error rates and the time of the last request.
From there, you can click through to the *Traffic* dashboard filtered to requests from a specific consumer.

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/consumers.png" alt="Consumers overview" />
  </div>
</Card>

To use this feature, your application must identify API consumers by providing a unique consumer identifier for each request. Check out the [setup guide](/quickstart) for your framework to learn more (it's easy!).
