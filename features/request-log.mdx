<Info>
Request log is an opt-in feature available on our paid plans only.
</Info>

The request log allows you to see a chronological list of all requests made to your API, allowing you to inspect details such as the request URL, headers, payloads and more.

There are several ways to filter and search the request log to find the requests you're interested in.

## Enable logging

By default, our client libraries do not send logs to Apitally to protect your data privacy.
You must explicitly enable logging in your application, and configure which aspects of the request and response you want to include.
There are also various options for masking sensitive data.

Learn more in the setup guide for your specific framework.
