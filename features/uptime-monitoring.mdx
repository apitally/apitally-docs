## Uptime monitoring

Apitally automatically checks whether your applications are running and reporting data every minute.
If Apitally stops receiving data from an environment, it will send you an alert. You can disable alerts for specific environments.

This feature is available on the free plan.

Note that your application may be unavailable to users even when it's running, for example due to networking issues.
That's where health checks come in.

## Health checks

Health checks monitor your application's availability by sending HTTP GET requests to a specified endpoint in 1 minute intervals.
If the endpoint returns a successful response within 5 seconds, your application is considered healthy.

<Tip>We recommend you use a dedicated health check endpoint that doesn't require authentication.</Tip>

If a health check request fails or times out, Apitally will retry the request once before sending you an alert.
The alert includes details about the failed request, so you can get to the bottom of the issue quickly.

Health checks are a premium feature and only available on our paid plans.
