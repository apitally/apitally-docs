## Errors dashboard

Monitoring API errors is crucial for maintaining a robust system.
Server errors (5xx) usually signal underlying issues with your API, such as bugs in your code or networking problems.

Paying attention to client errors (4xx) is equally important, even if some are anticipated and not indicative of API problems.
Analyzing client errors can provide valuable insights into how systems interact with your API.
It can aid in refining your API's design or documentation, and even uncover potential issues within those systems.

The Apitally dashboard allows you to visualize error rates over time and per endpoint and gives you a breakdown of response status codes.

### Validation errors

Validating incoming requests is a fundamental task for API developers and frameworks.
Many frameworks offer built-in validation capabilities, or are compatible with third-party validation libraries.

Apitally provides insights into specific validation errors encountered by your API consumers, which can help you refine validation rules or reveal issues on the consumer side.

This feature is currently supported for the following frameworks:

- FastAPI (using pydantic)
- Django Ninja (using pydantic)
- Litestar (using pydantic, attrs or other modeling libraries)
- Express (using express-validator or Joi + celebrate)
- Fastify (using Ajv)
- NestJS (using class-validator)
