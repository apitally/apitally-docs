## Managing API keys

Apitally makes it super easy and secure to manage API keys for your applications.
You can rest assured that your API keys are never stored in plaintext, but are always hashed using a secure algorithm (scrypt).

When you create API keys in Apitally, you can map them to one or multiple environments, assign permissions (using scopes) and set an expiration date.

You can also disable and re-enable API keys at any time or rotate API keys with a configurable grace period.
During the grace period, both the old and new API key are valid to give you time to update the client systems without causing disruptions.

## Tracking API key usage

It's important to keep an eye out for API keys that are no longer in use, so you can disable them and prevent unauthorized access.

To facilitate this, Apitally tracks API key usage and shows you the time of the last usage for each API key.
Additionally, you can view a chart showing usage counts per day, for the last 30 days.

## Managing scopes

Apitally provides the ability to define scopes, which can then be assigned to your API keys.
This allows you to grant consumers different levels of access to your API endpoints or resources.

## Importing API keys

If you have existing API keys that you'd like to manage in Apitally, you can easily import them using our import feature.
Simply provide them in a CSV format, optionally with names and expiration dates.

## Integration with your app

The Apitally client libraries integrate neatly with your application to allow you to secure endpoints with API key authentication using the mechanisms provided by your web framework.
Once set up, valid API key hashes are automatically synchronized with your application once every minute.

Our [setup guides](/quickstart) include detailed instructions and examples for each supported framework to get you started in no time.
