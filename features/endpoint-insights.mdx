By clicking on a row in the [endpoints table](/features/traffic-dashboard#endpoints-table) on the traffic dashboard, you can access detailed insights into the usage and performance of that specific API endpoint.

The endpoint insights are presented in a tabbed interface with the sections described below.

## Info

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/endpoint-insights-info.webp" alt="Endpoint insights - Info tab" />
  </div>
</Card>

The *Info* tab presents metadata about the endpoint, such as the summary and description, if provided by your application (e.g. via the OpenAPI schema).

## Requests

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/endpoint-insights-requests.webp" alt="Endpoint insights - Requests tab" />
  </div>
</Card>

The *Requests* tab provides different breakdowns of the requests made to the API endpoint. At the top you see a summary with the following metrics:

- Total requests
- Requests per minute
- Successful requests
- Client errors
- Server errors

Below the summary, you find a bar chart showing the distribution of requests over time, broken down by successful and failed requests.

The horizontal bar chart at the bottom shows which API consumers have been making the most requests to this endpoint (top 10).
Again, this is broken down by successful and failed requests.

## Errors

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/endpoint-insights-errors.webp" alt="Endpoint insights - Errors tab" />
  </div>
</Card>

The *Errors* tab provides details about failed requests to your API endpoint.
Requests are considered unsuccessful if the response status code is in the 4xx or 5xx range, and the specific status code has not been marked as expected.

At the top you see a breakdown of unsuccessful status codes returned by the endpoint, along with the number of occurrences and the percentage of all requests.
You can click on the status codes to navigate to the [errors dashboard](/features/errors-dashboard), which provides more detailed insights into that specific error.

## Response times

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/endpoint-insights-response-times.webp" alt="Endpoint insights - Response times tab" />
  </div>
</Card>

...

## Data transferred

<Card>
  <div style={{ margin: "-1.25rem -1.5rem" }}>
    <img src="https://assets.apitally.io/docs/endpoint-insights-data-transferred.webp" alt="Endpoint insights - Data transferred tab" />
  </div>
</Card>

Apitally records the payload size of each API request and response based on the `Content-Length` headers.
It provides insights into the distribution of payload sizes for specific endpoints as well as the overall amount of data transferred.
