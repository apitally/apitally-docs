## Capturing endpoint descriptions

If your application makes its OpenAPI specification (often named `openapi.json`) available in an endpoint, Apitally can use that to enrich the captured metadata about your endpoints with descriptions.
These will then be shown in the modal that appears when you click on an endpoint on the _Traffic_ page in the dashboard.

FastAPI provides this out of the box, and Apitally is already configured to use it.
For other frameworks you can explicitly set the `openapi_url` / `openApiUrl` argument when adding the middleware to your application:

<CodeGroup>
```python Flask
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="dev",
    openapi_url="/openapi.json",  # <--
)
```

```python Django
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "dev",
    "openapi_url": "/api/openapi",  # <--
}
```

```javascript Express / Koa
useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev",
  openApiUrl: "/api-docs", // <--
});
```

```javascript Fastify
await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev",
  openApiUrl: "/docs/json", // <--
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Reporting app versions

Apitally can display the currently deployed version of your app in the tooltip that appears if you hover over the environment pills on the _Apps_ page in the dashboard.
This can be useful if you have multiple environments and want to know which version of your app is running in each environment.

To report the app version, set the `app_version` / `appVersion` argument when adding the middleware to your application:

<CodeGroup>
```python FastAPI / Starlette
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="dev",
    app_version="1.0.0",  # <--
)
```

```python Flask
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    env="dev",
    app_version="1.0.0",  # <--
)
```

```python Django
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "env": "dev",
    "app_version": "1.0.0",  # <--
}
```

```javascript Express / Koa
useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev",
  appVersion: "1.0.0", // <--
});
```

```javascript Fastify
await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev",
  appVersion: "1.0.0", // <--
});
```
</CodeGroup>
