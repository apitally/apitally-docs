## Capturing endpoint descriptions

If your application makes its OpenAPI specification (often named `openapi.json`) available in an endpoint, Apitally can use that to enrich the captured metadata about your endpoints with descriptions.
These will then be shown in the modal that appears when you click on an endpoint on the _Traffic_ page in the dashboard.

FastAPI provides this out of the box, and Apitally is already configured to use it.
For other frameworks you can explicitly set the `openapi_url` / `openApiUrl` argument when adding the middleware to your application:

<CodeGroup>
```python Flask
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    openapi_url="/openapi.json",  # <--
)
```

```python Django
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "openapi_url": "/api/openapi",  # <--
}
```

```javascript Express / Koa
useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  openApiUrl: "/api-docs", // <--
});
```

```javascript Fastify
await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  openApiUrl: "/docs/json", // <--
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Reporting app versions

Apitally can display the currently deployed version of your app in the tooltip that appears if you hover over the environment pills on the _Apps_ page in the dashboard.
This can be useful if you have multiple environments and want to know which version of your app is running in each environment.

To report the app version, set the `app_version` / `appVersion` argument when adding the middleware to your application:

<CodeGroup>
```python FastAPI / Starlette
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    app_version="1.0.0",  # <--
)
```

```python Flask
app.wsgi_app = ApitallyMiddleware(
    app,
    client_id="your-client-id",
    app_version="1.0.0",  # <--
)
```

```python Django
APITALLY_MIDDLEWARE = {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "app_version": "1.0.0",  # <--
}
```

```javascript Express / Koa
useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  appVersion: "1.0.0", // <--
});
```

```javascript Fastify
await fastify.register(apitallyPlugin, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  appVersion: "1.0.0", // <--
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Caching API key hashes

If you're using Apitally's API key management, your application will fetch API key hashes from the Apitally Hub on startup (and then again every minute).
Should the initial synchronization fail, for example due to temporary network issues, your application will exit (with code 1) as it won't be able to authenticate requests.

If this scenario worries you, you can cache API key hashes in your application by implementing a class with `store()` and `retrieve()` methods and passing it to the `key_cache_class` / `keyCacheClass` argument when adding the middleware.

The examples below uses Redis to cache the API key hashes, but you can use any storage you want, as long as it persists between restarts of your application.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import redis
from apitally.client.base import ApitallyKeyCacheBase

r = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379, decode_responses=True)

class ApitallyKeyCache(ApitallyKeyCacheBase):
    def store(self, data: str) -> None:
        r.set(self.cache_key, data)

    def retrieve(self) -> str | None:
        return r.get(self.cache_key)
```

```javascript Node.js
import { KeyCacheBase } from "apitally/common";
import { createClient } from "redis";

const redis = createClient();
await redis.connect();

class ApitallyKeyCache extends KeyCacheBase {
  async store(data: string) {
    await redis.set(this.cacheKey, data);
  }

  async retrieve(): string | null {
    return await redis.get(this.cacheKey);
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
